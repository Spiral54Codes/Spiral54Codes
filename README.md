Heya dudes. I go by @Spiral54Codes, but Spiral is also fine.
I am a male programmer, drawer, music producer and sometimes a rapper.
I’m currently learning Python, PyGame0 and C++
I’m looking to collaborate on an FNF mod, but dont have the coding knowledge for it. I can draw, make the instrumentals and have the lore and scripts prepared
Please talk with me in amonrom@icloud.com , my main mail address
